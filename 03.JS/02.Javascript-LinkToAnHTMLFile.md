# JavaScript Link to an external file

---

Let's include some JavaScript in our HTML !

The easiest way to do it is to open a `<script>` tag in our HTML and we can already type some code that will be runned by the browser.

But, as with CSS, this is not the best way to do it. The best practice is to link a javascript file to the HTML. That's done as such :

```css
<script src="myJsFile.js"></script>
```

But where to put it ?

You can really put it anywhere. It will work. But the best practice is to place it at the very end of your document, just before de closing `body` tag.

This way, we make sure the whole page is loaded before we start running our script.

Another way to use JavaScript (and we will use it often to debug) is running it in the **console**. I strongly recommend you use it for small operations, before writing the code on your javascript file.
